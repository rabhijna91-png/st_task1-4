The main objective of Task 01 is to understand and apply the concept of data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Pandas. This task focuses on creating a bar chart or histogram to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable effectively. 
The main objective of Task 02 is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a chosen dataset such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This task aims to develop a deeper understanding of the dataset by identifying relationships, patterns, and trends through statistical and graphical methods. 
The main objective of Task 03 is to build a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. This task focuses on understanding how machine learning algorithms can be applied for predictive analysis using real-world data, such as the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The main objective of Task 04 is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. This task focuses on uncovering accident hotspots and contributing factors through data analysis and visualization techniques.
